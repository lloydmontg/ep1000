				<h3><a id="prototyping">Cardboard Prototyping</a></h3>
					<p> This week's task is to prototype a handphone dock using cardboard. It initially presented relatively simple, but creating it to be as portable and compact proved a challenge on its own.
					The process of prototyping began with looking into various works done prior by other people on the Internet. I have downloaded many of the images for personal reference, but as I am not legally permitted to simply rehost the images on the site
					I will not be embedding any here. Typically, I have noticed that many phone stands have a degree of versatility to their design, allowing it to dock phones in both portrait and landscape orientations, change viewing angles, or even charge the phone while docked.
					This is a vital part of a phone stand that creates the universal usability within the mobile market range where phones and tablet devices range from small compact devices to the much larger screen tablets. My sample device for testing is a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 with no external protective case (this is important to specify as the thickness that some cases can add will majorly 
					affect the fit and stability of the stand.)</p>
					
				<h3><a id="3dcad">3D Computer Aided Design in Fusion 360</a></h3>
					<p> This task is part 1 of 2 of the 3D Modelling and Printing section of the module. As of right now I have a keychain sample file available for download which I am also going to preview it here.
					Unfortunately I am incredibly uncreative at the time of modelling this keychain and have opted for a very basic design. Anyway have fun.</p>
