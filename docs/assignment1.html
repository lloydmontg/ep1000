			<h2> Assignment 1: Cardboard Prototyping (23 ~ 26 Oct 2020) </h2>
				<p> This assignment involves the use of corrugated cardboard as the main material and basic techniques such as <br>
					<ul>
						<li>Tabs</li>
						<li>Slots</li>
						<li>Slots and Tabs</li>
						<li>Gussets</li>
						<li>Score and Bend</li>
						<li>Flanges</li>
					</ul>
				to create a prototype of a portable mobile phone stand in full scale.</p>
				<p> During this assignment, we were required to sketch the concept in 2D with measurements and references to prior projects found online for ideas.<br>
				Following this, we had to create the life size prototype as a proof of concept.</p>
				<p> Initially, I had intended to create the simplest thing I had thought of. Simple christmas ornaments were often made of cardstock slotted together to form a standing Christmas tree.<br>
				Hence, I decided to begin my design from that point. It had to had a slot, or otherwise a means to hold the mobile phone in place, and had to be high enough to also dock while charging as it is the greatest point of inactivity.</p>
				<p> My initial sketch came down to this:</p>

				<br>
				<p> In order to test this concept, I had to build it out of corrugated cardboard as an initial prototype.<br>
				Corrugated cardboard is easy to find for cheap or from recycling, is strong, and is an extremely easy material to work with with just basic tools like a box cutter and the standard Elmer's glue.</p>
				<p>Cutting out the pieces required some care as to not affect the structural integrity of the piece. As the support of the cardboard runs on only one axis, cutting it along the grain may be detrimental to the overall strength and durability of the finished prototype</p>
				<p>The finished model was surprisingly simple - no glue was required at all! The slots and tabs lock into their corresponding joints and are stable, but still able to release into its base two pieces that allow for flat storage.</p>

					<br>
				<p>In general, I think I may have been able to further improve the model's joint strength by doublelocking it instead of the single slot/tab system that is currently used. I would also cut a small slot out for the phone's cable to run through, so that it would be much easier to charge in dock stably. </p>
